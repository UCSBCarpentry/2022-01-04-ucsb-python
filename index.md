SCHEDULE

Show the workshop's schedule.

Small changes to the schedule can be made by modifying the
`schedule.html` found in the `_includes` folder for your
workshop type (`swc`, `lc`, or `dc`). Edit the items and
times in the table to match your plans. You may also want to
change 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' to be actual dates or days of the
week.

For larger changes, a blank template for a 4-day workshop
(useful for online teaching for instance) can be found in
`_includes/custom-schedule.html`. Add the times, and what
you will be teaching to this file. You may also want to add
rows to the table if you wish to break down the schedule
further. To use this custom schedule here, replace the block
of code below the Schedule `<h2>` header below with
`{% include custom-schedule.html %}`.

## Installing Python using Anaconda

[Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for
general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of the scientific packages we use in the lesson
individually can be a bit cumbersome, and therefore recommend the all-in-one
installer [Anaconda][anaconda].

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python
version 3.x (e.g., 3.6 is fine).

1.  Open <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> in your web browser.
2.  Download the Anaconda Python 3 installer for Windows.
3.  Double-click the executable and install Python 3 using the recommended settings.
    Make sure that **Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.x** option is checked --
    it should be in the latest version of Anaconda.
4.  Verify the installation:
    click Start, search and select `Anaconda Prompt` from the menu.
    A window should pop up where you can now type commands
    such as checking your Conda installation with:

    ~~~
    conda --help

1.  Visit <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> in your web browser.
2.  Download the Anaconda Python 3 installer for macOS.
    These instructions assume that you use the graphical installer `.pkg` file.
3.  Follow the Anaconda Python 3 installation instructions.
    Make sure that the install location is set to "Install only for me"
    so Anaconda will install its files locally, relative to your home directory.
    Installing the software for all users tends to create problems in the long run
    and should be avoided.
4.  Verify the installation:
    click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.

Note that the following installation steps require you to work from the terminal (shell).
If you run into any difficulties, please request help before the workshop begins.

1.  Open <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> in your web browser.
2.  Download the Anaconda Python 3 installer for Linux.
3.  Install Anaconda using all of the defaults for installation.
    * Open a terminal window.
    * Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the installer.
    * Type `bash Anaconda3-` and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
      The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
    * Press <kbd>Return</kbd>

      will be present at the bottom of the screen) press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> until you see the
      bottom of the text. Type `yes` and press <kbd>Return</kbd> to approve the license. Press
      <kbd>Return</kbd> again to approve the default location for the files. Type `yes` and
      press <kbd>Return</kbd> to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda
      distribution your user's default Python).
4.  Verify the installation:
    this depends a bit on your Linux distribution, but often you will have an Applications listing
    in which you can select a Terminal icon you can click. A window should pop up where you can now

## Required Python Packages

The following are packages needed for this workshop:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

All packages apart from `plotnine` will have automatically been installed with Anaconda
and we can use Anaconda as a package manager to install the missing `plotnine` package:
You need to open up a *Terminal*, if you are using Mac OSX, or Linux (see instructions above),
or launch an *anaconda-promt*, if you are using Windows. In your terminal window type the following:

~~~
conda install -y -c conda-forge plotnine
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This will then install the latest version of plotnine into your conda environment.

## Required packages: Miniconda

Miniconda is a lightweight version of Anaconda. If you install Miniconda instead of Anaconda,
you need to install required packages manually in the following way:
~~~
conda install -y numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
~~~
{: .language-bash}

[environment.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson/gh-pages/environment.yml)
file by right-clicking the link and selecting save as.
In the directory where you downloaded the environment.yml file run:

~~~
conda env create -f environment.yml
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Activate the new environment with:
~~~
conda activate python-ecology-lesson
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You can deactivate the environment with:

## Launch a Jupyter notebook

After installing either Anaconda or Miniconda and the workshop packages,
launch a Jupyter notebook by typing this command from the terminal:

~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The notebook should open automatically in your browser. If it does not or you
wish to use a different browser, open this link: <http://localhost:8888>.

For a brief introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, please consult our
